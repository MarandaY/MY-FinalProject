                <p>I follow a fair few amount of artists on social media, some of which have their own original characters that I really like. I wanted to draw this as a gift for one of those artists, since I simply loved his design!</p>

                <h2 class="fun"></h2>
                <p>This was a drawing that I made when I was getting pretty into some obscure internet horror stories. That, and there was a song I was listening to on repeat that inspired me to do my own version of the art. It was pretty fun to make!</p>

                <p>Another drawing I made while I was pretty into internet horror stories, I thought it'd be fun to make something quickly so I could practice coloring on my new tablet (and just drawing on it in general).</p>

                <p>This one was actually a redraw of something I drew back in Middle School! I wanted to see how far I've progressed as an artist, so I decided on redrawing this piece since it was one that I didn't hate as much as the others.</p>

                <p>This is something I had a lot of fun making even though it was a commission! I'm a big fan of dragon features and I already have a lot of fun drawing hybrids as well. This commission was a treat to make!</p>

                <p>This was a drawing that I made really quickly last year for what's affectionately dubbed as "Rockman Day" in Japan, although American fans often make their own art to celebrate it as well. I adore the series, so I was very inspired to do something cute!</p>
